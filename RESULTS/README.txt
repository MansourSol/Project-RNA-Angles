In this folder can be found 5 main folders, that are:
MAE after training: (2 subfolders)
  - MeanBinary: Here, we have the MAE for all files with the binary classification after training the model and the overall mean.
  - Reverse_TestBinaireYPRED: Here, we have the angle value obtained through the binary classification for all test files.

MAE before training: (6 subfolders)
  - MeanBinary: Same as after training but before training the model.
  - MeanMulti: Here, we have the MAE for all the files with the multiclassification before training the model and the overall mean.
  - Reverse_TestBinaire: Here, we have the angle value obtained through the binary classification for all test files.
  - Reverse_TestMulti: Here, we have the angle value obtained through the multiclassification for all test files.
  - Reverse_TrainBinaire: Here, we have the angle value obtained through the binary classification for all train files.
  - Reverse_TrainMulti: Here, we have the angle value obtained through the multiclassification for all train files.
