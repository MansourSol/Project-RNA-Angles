# Project-RNA-Angles

The goal of this project is to predict the alpha angles of an RNA sequence from a fasta file that will be returned in a json file.

Inside this git project are multiple folders :
- DATA
- DATA MODIFIED
- RESULTS
- SRC

Folder DATA : 
contains the initial data we used from rsRNASP (for the Train set) and RNA puzzles (for the Test set)

Folder DATA MODIFIED :
contains all the intermediate files that are created along the workflow.

Folder RESULTS :
contains the various results obtained : the predicted classes and angles, and the MAE (mean absolute error).

Folder SRC :
contains the various programs of the workflow.

This project was done in the context of the subject BIOINFORMATICS OF RNA by Jade COCHET, Marie CROQUET, Naëla GOURRI and Solène MANSOUR.
