This folder contains two main folders:
- DEEP LEARNING
- PROCESS

DEEP LEARNING :
contains the two MLP one fofr the binary classification and the multiple classes classification. Also there are two code (binary, multiple) for the computation of the metrics.

PROCESS :
contains all the codes that were used for the pre-processing of the data :
- The creation of the matrices for the test/train set
- The computation of the MAE for both classification type (binary/multiple)
- The assignation of classes for both classification type (binary/multiple)
- The codes that allow to tranfsorm the class predicted into the corresponding angle.

There are two remaining files that
